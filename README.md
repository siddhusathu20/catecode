# catecode
A program to encode and decode text in a cipher I created.

--How it works--
A dot next to a letter indicates that it is a vowel. A hyphen indicates that it is a consonant. The letter itself indicates the position of the coded letter in the list of vowels or consonants. Also, Y is considered a vowel.
